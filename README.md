# BookABarber

This was a project I worked on for the CodeCrew 2022 Hackathon based off the theme of Barber Shops.
This is the first project that really challenged me to utilize all of the skills I had learned so far.


Be warned, however. Due to time constraints and a need to utilize github pages, the links for the buttons that lead to the next pages lead to the github pages versions of the website.
